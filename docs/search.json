Intended Users Applications Water Utilities Service Providers: monitor quality water different sources, schedule maintenance treatment, improve service delivery. Environmental Health Officers District Councils: identify unsafe water points, plan targeted inspections, coordinate local water safety interventions. WASH Program Implementers: assess baseline water quality conditions, prioritize high-risk areas, track impact water safety programs. Academic Institutions Research Bodies: analyze regional seasonal trends water quality contribute evidence base safe water practices low-resource settings. Government Ministries: inform national water safety planning, update regulations, allocate resources based real-world data. Development Agencies International Donors: evaluate program outcomes, justify investments, align support areas greatest water quality need.","code":""},{"path":"https://github.com/openwashdata/boreholelabdata/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"Water Quality Laboratory Analysis and Reporting Dataset – Malawi (2017–2019)","text":"can install development version boreholelabdata GitHub : Alternatively, can download individual datasets CSV XLSX file table .
